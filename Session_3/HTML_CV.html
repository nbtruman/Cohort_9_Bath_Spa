            <article>I'm passionate about learning new things and I'm always looking for a new project. While i'm currently learning web development for career advancement, i'm also teaching myself CAD and experimenting with 3D printing. The exploration of new technologies is most exciting where the digital and physical meet. I enjoy challenging my mind and body equally; during my time in the army i was the captain of my regimental British Army Warrior Fitness (BAWF) team. Now i try to help others achieve their physical goals while staying injury-free. My current goal is to transition into a tech role as a web developer.</article>
