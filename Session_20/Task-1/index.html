        <p >My favourite season is Autumn, with its rust coloured leaves and a crisp chill in the air.
            <br>

            It's a great time of year to start any big landscaping job.

            October and November are great times to rake up fallen leaves or just enjoy</p>

        <p>My favourite activity is driving in the rain to the nearest shop to buy wine.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also I often watch people and their behaviour.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am amazed at how some people walk out in the rain, a rain jacket on but no umbrella, while others are fighting for an umbrella in the wind and rain.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think there are also people that are in love with the rain, and they find the rain especially romantic.

            There's also this whole thing about the number 6.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think that's why there are only two colours in the world that aren't either black or white.
            <br>
            <br>
            Numbers are just combinations of two other numbers.

        <p>My favourite place is Africa.

            I'd never been there before I visited the Vatican Museum, which is the museum that documents the history and art from all over the world.
